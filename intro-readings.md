# 1.9 Further reading
* Armstrong (2001) covers the whole field of forecasting, with each chapter written by different experts. It is highly opinionated at times (and we donâ€™t agree with everything in it), but it is full of excellent general advice on tackling forecasting problems.
* Ord, Fildes, & Kourentzes (2017) is a forecasting textbook covering some of the same areas as this book, but with a different emphasis and not focused around any particular software environment. It is written by three highly respected forecasters, with many decades of experience between them.
